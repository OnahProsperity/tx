# **About Vitalik Buterin.**

#### Vitalik Buterin is a Russian-Canadian writer and programmer. Vitalik was involved in the Bitcoin community since 2011, co-founding and writing articles for Bitcoin magazine. But he is primarily known as the boy-genius behind Ethereum, the world’s second-most valued and recognized cryptocurrency platform behind Bitcoin. At the time of writing, his visionary project boasts an enormous market cap of over $65 bln dollars, and it keeps growing. Meanwhile, Vitalik is only 23 years of age and has far-reaching plans for his creation.

  Childhood
</h4>

#### Vitalik was born on Jan. 31, 1994 in a town of Kolomna, Moscow Oblast, Russia. He lived in Russia until the age of 6 when his parents decided to emigrate to Canada in search of better employment opportunities.

#### When he was in third grade of a Canadian primary school, he was placed in a program for the gifted. And while getting a place in this program meant more learning opportunities, he was basically abruptly sundered from his friends. While in the program, Vitalik quickly realized that his particular set of skills and talents made him somewhat of an oddity to his peers and even teachers. He was naturally predisposed to math and programming, possessed an early and strong interest in economics, and could add three-digit numbers in his head twice as fast as an average human being of his age.

#### Perhaps, it was his search for a new passion in life that led Vitalik to the world of cryptocurrencies. He first heard of Bitcoin from his father, who himself had a software startup back in 2013. He didn’t get into it straight away. Moreover, he initially thought that the cryptocurrency is inevitably going to fail, as it has no intrinsic value. However, later on, he heard about it a few times more and started to develop interest. As he said himself, if you hear about something twice, it might be a good idea to invest some time and find out more.

#### Already at that time, Vitalik viewed everything to do with government regulation or corporate control as just something plain evil. Naturally, the decentralized and uncontrollable nature of Bitcoin attracted his interest. Even though his policy on good and evil has been substantially updated since then, Vitalik is still motivated by his conviction that the powerful have way too much power in their hands.

#### Buterin ended up spending his time on various Bitcoin-related forums, researching the network. In the beginning, it was purely the cryptocurrency element of the network that attracted his attention, but as he was getting more and more involved in the community, he started gaining an understanding of the virtually unlimited potential of the technology behind Bitcoin.

#### He wanted to formally join this new and experimental economy by getting his hands on some tokens, but he had neither the computing power to mine them nor the cash to purchase Bitcoins. So, he looked for work paid for in Bitcoins on various forums and eventually began writing articles for a blog, which earned him around five Bitcoins per article.

#### Through his forum work and articles, Vitalik strived to get more understanding and experience of Bitcoin, as well as get some exposure in the community. At the same time, he was looking into all the different economical, technological, and political aspects of the cryptocurrency. His articles attracted the attention of Mihai Alisie, a Romania-based Bitcoin enthusiast, which lead to the two actively corresponding and eventually, in late 2011, co-founding Bitcoin Magazine. Buterin took the job of head writer for the magazine while doing another part-time job as a research assistant for the cryptographer Ian Goldberg. Moreover, Vitalik was taking five advanced courses at the University of Waterloo at the same time.

#### In May 2013, he took a trip to San Jose, California to attend a Bitcoin-related conference as a representative of Bitcoin Magazine. It was the first time Buterin witnessed that the community that was appearing around the cryptocurrency was alive and kicking, which convinced him that this is a project really worth getting into. Later that year, Vitalik dropped out of the university and spent some of the Bitcoins he amassed to travel around the world and meet the people who were trying to extend the capabilities of the Bitcoin network and make it into a bigger, more capable version of itself.

## **Ethereum** {#contentRef_2}

#### In late 2013, Vitalik Buterin described his idea in a white paper, which he sent out to a few of his friends, who in turn sent it out further. As a result, about 30 people reached out to Vitalik to discuss the concept. He was waiting for critical reviews and people pointing out critical mistakes in the concept, but it never happened.

<h4 dir="ltr">
  Even then, the concept of Ethereum was still very much about the currency. The idea changed and shaped over time, during meetings and discussions with the people fully on board with the idea. Once they had the programming language, they were just coming up with new ways to use it every week. By the end of January 2014, the team has realized that it is relatively easy to create decentralized file storage, and concepts like name registry can be brought to life with just a couple of lines of code. As those use cases piled up, they slowly changed Vitalik’s idea and gradually shaped it into what Ethereum is today.

#### The project was publicly announced in January 2014, with the core team consisting of Vitalik Buterin, Mihai Alisie, Anthony Di Iorio, Charles Hoskinson, Joe Lubin, and Gavin Wood. Buterin also presented Ethereum on stage at a Bitcoin conference in Miami, and just a few months later the team decided to hold a crowdsale of Ether, the native token of the network, to fund the development. Around the same time, Vitalik himself received the Thiel Fellowship grant in the amount of $100,000.

#### Through the crowdsale, during which Ether was sold for Bitcoins, the team raised more than 31,000 BTC from the cryptocurrency community, which amounted to about $18 mln at the time. However, during the crowdsale Bitcoin was trading at around $650, but soon after its price plummeted, and the team had to face an entirely avoidable loss of millions of dollars. Nevertheless, with the money raised the Ethereum team established the Ethereum Foundation, a non-profit organization based in Switzerland, which was tasked with overseeing the development of Ethereum’s open-source software.

## **Fake news about his death** {#contentRef_8}

#### On June 25, 2017, a fake news report claiming that Vitalik Buterin died in a car crash, caused Ether to lose $4 bln in market value. The story originated from 4Chan, an anonymous imageboard, and a trolls’ paradise. Although Ethereum retained all of the lost value, the hoax has highlighted the importance of Vitalik to the platform and the whole cryptocurrency and Blockchain community. Perhaps, the complete anonymity retained by the creators of Bitcoin was a very smart move after all.

## **Now** {#contentRef_9}

<h4 dir="ltr">
  These days Vitalik is living in Singapore and working on his creation as hard as ever. In the very beginning, only three people were working on Ethereum protocols, but he is hoping that the team will soon reach the level when it will require less and less of his presence.
</h4>

#### He remains optimistic about the future of the platform, saying that the only Ethereum killer is Ethereum. Buterin and his team are preparing for roll-outs of new, more stable, safe, and efficient versions of Ethereum, citing scalability, optimisation, cost-effectivity, and security as their biggest challenges.
