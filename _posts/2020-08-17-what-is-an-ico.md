## **ICO Definition**

ICO is a fund-raising mechanism that blockchain startups use to get funds for project development. Normally, a project offers its own tokens to investors in exchange for well-known cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

During such crowdfunding, projects sell utility or security tokens. Utility tokens are sold during ICOs that are largely unregulated. Security tokens are sold in regulated Security Token Offerings or STOs.

## **History And Statistics**

letâ€™s have a look at the history of ICOs. How did it all start?

[Ripple organized](https://blockgeeks.com/guides/initial-coin-offering/)Â the first Initial Coin Offering. In 2013 the Ripple team created 100 bln XRP tokens and offered them for sale. They promised to use the funds to develop the project.

One of the most famous cryptos, funded by an ICO, is Ethereum. In 2014, the Ethereum Foundation was selling ETH tokens for 0.0005 BTC each. The team raised an impressive amount ofÂ [over 18 million USD](https://bernardmarr.com/default.asp?contentID=1306). It was one of the most successful crowdfunding campaigns ever, starting the era of ICOs.

  Literally anyone! Currently, there&#8217;s very little regulation on ICOs in America, meaning as long as you can get the tech set up you&#8217;re free to try and get your currency funded. Right now cryptocurrency as a whole is kind of like the wild west; there&#8217;s gold in the hills and relatively little law to speak of. This can work in your favor or it can lead to getting swindled. Of all avenues of funding, an ICO is probably one of the easiest to set up as a scam. Since there&#8217;s no regulation there&#8217;s nothing stopping someone from doing all the work to make you believe they have a great idea, and then absconding with the money.

  This means that if you&#8217;re really set on getting in on that new ICO that your friend Aiden from work told you about, make sure you do your homework. The first thing to do isÂ make sure that the people putting up the ICO are real and accountable. In the internet age it&#8217;s beyond easy to find a stock photo and put together a convincing website, so going theÂ extra mile is important. Some things to look for: What history do the product&#8217;s leads have with crypto or blockchain? If it looks like they don&#8217;t have anyone with relevant experience that can be easily verified, that&#8217;s a bad sign.

<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-19" class="comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">
  The most important thing you want to do is make sure that either you or someone (probably multiple people) involved have worked in and understand cryptocurrencyÂ andÂ <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/091316/top-3-books-learn-about-blockchain.asp" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">blockchain</a>. Even if anyone can make an ICO, it doesn&#8217;t mean that everyone should. You need to be able to answer questions on the spot about every little detail pertaining to your ICO.

  You should also ask yourself if you really think that your business will actively benefit from an ICO. Basically, after reading this article, you should consult someone who can take a look at your specific idea and tell you if it is a slam dunk or not. If it&#8217;s not, you might be better off going through safer avenues of funding.

  If you&#8217;re determined to move forward, you need aÂ white paper, which is a document that should identifyÂ exactly what your currency can offer that has never been done before, or how you&#8217;ll make an established ideaÂ better than anyone else has. This document should be engaging, informative, and very, very detailed, like theÂ <a href="http://blockchainlab.com/pdf/Ethereum_white_paper-a_next_generation_smart_contract_and_decentralized_application_platform-vitalik-buterin.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2">white paper for Ethereum</a>, one ofÂ the most successful ICOs yet.

  Like any business, you need to hook your buyer by the end of the first page. Ethereum&#8217;sÂ white paper takes the time to explain what blockchain is,Â and then goes on to detail how they intend to build on the progress that Satoshi NakamotoÂ made and create something exciting. They do all ofÂ this by the end of the first page. Now, does every single white paper need to include an unabridged history of blockchain including theÂ time that guy paid 10,000 bitcoins for a pizza? Probably not, but it should be understandable to someone without any knowledge of how these systems work.
