# What is the difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum?

Ethereum and Bitcoin share many similarities. In this article, weâ€™ll try to highlight the most fundamental differences between them.

The biggest difference is the purposes or ultimate goals of these projects.

Bitcoin aims to be a store of wealth, aÂ digital goldÂ if you will, and eventually become a globally adopted currency which could improve or replace conventional money to some extent. The purpose of Ethereum is to become a platform upon which smart contracts and decentralised apps can run.

Another important difference is the supply. Where the number of Bitcoin is capped at 21 million ever to be produced, Ethereum is not capped to any specific quantity. Both Bitcoin and Ethereum are produced in a process calledÂ mining. There are plans to shift Ethereum production to a proof of stake model, which should be more environmentally friendly than mining. <!--more-->

There are several technical differences in the technologies that underpin the Bitcoin and Ethereum platforms but at this early stage of these projects, they may seem very much alike. As these projects grow and mature, however, the differences may become much more apparent and could affect their trajectories quite differently.

In many ways, Ethereum is similar to Bitcoin. Itâ€™s a public, peer-to-peer network or blockchain with its own cryptocurrency called Ether. Ethereum was created by Vitalik Buterin in 2014 and the purpose of Ethereum is to be a platform on which smart contracts can be built and run.

Put very simply, Ethereum is intended to be a world computer.

Where Bitcoin stores a list of balances and transactions on its blockchain, the Ethereum blockchain is designed to store different types of data. This data can be accessed and used by computer programs running on the Ethereum blockchain. These programs are called decentralized apps, or dapps.

Developers around the world can build and run decentralized applications on the Ethereum blockchain. The purpose of these is to improve the industries of finance, personal information storage, governance and more by using the transparent nature of a blockchain
